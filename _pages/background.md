I was introduced to the world of signal processing and machine learning in my undergrad days through courses and hobby projects on audio-based emotion classification. I was fascinated by the idea of breaking down activities and phenomena into numbers and analyzing them with numerical and model-based tools. Subsequently, the special course on Machine Learning for Medical Image Analsyis offerred by my undergrad school - NIT Karnataka, in collaboration with Baylor College of Medicine, piqued my interest. Hence, I started my PhD in Johns Hopkins University focusing my research on developing trustworthy ML models for diagnostic and therapeutic applicaitons, particularly for neurological disorders. 


 I am currently affiliated with Boston University and Johns Hopkins.. My research broadly focuses on biomarker identification and improving human-in-loop diagnostic models for neurological disorders like Epilepsy and Autism using my expertise in deep learning, bayesian modeling, medical imaging, and signal processing. In particular, I aim to develop interpretable AI models of clinical utility while dealing with the challenges of small dataset and noisy labels. I have developed a transformer-based architecture for joint spatial and temporal localization of seizure onset zone in epileptic patients using scalp EEG (MICCAI'23). I am currently extending this work to incorporate bayesian training in the presence of incorrect/noisy labels. Additionally, I am working in collaboration with University of Virgina on developing multi-modal data analysis for Austism Spectrum Disorder. 

Being an extrovert, most of my ideas are inspired by my conversation with experts and fellow researchers in the field. I like to be creative in my ideas without breaking the barriers of simplicity and utility. I find it satisfying to help build technology that is of clinical importance which I have priorotized in my career choice - starting with my research internship at EPFL Switzerland in 2020 where I helped develop AI model for COVID-19 detection using recordings from digital stethoscope. I envision working towards similar goals in the future with a focus on neurological disorders, mental health management, and women health. I work towards all-rounded growth and holistic lifestyle through active community involvement, art and culture, sustainable health, and informed personal choices.
