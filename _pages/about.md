I am a PhD student in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at [Johns Hopkins University](https://engineering.jhu.edu/ece/) and a visting researcher at [Boston University](https://www.bu.edu/eng/academics/departments-and-divisions/electrical-and-computer-engineering/). I am advised by [Dr. Archana Venkataraman](https://www.bu.edu/eng/profile/archana-venkataraman-ph-d/). My research interests lie in the intersection of Probabilistic Machine learning, Deep Learning, Signal Processing, and Medical Imaging. It involves high-dimesnional signal analysis with applications to diagnosis and therapeutics for neurological disorders.

Previously, I worked as a Data Research Analsyst at [intelligent Global Health](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/mlo/igh-intelligent-global-health/) group of Machine Learning and Optimization lab at EPFL, Switzerland headed by [Dr. Martin Jaggi](https://people.epfl.ch/martin.jaggi). I also worked closely with [Dr. Mary-Anne Hartley](https://www.yale-light.org/) and [Dr. Tatjana Chavdarova](https://chavdarova.github.io/). Here, I contributed to the development of interpretable deep models for diagnosing respiratory ailments, particularly COVID-19, through recorded lung auscultation signals.

I graduated from the Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering at [National Institute of Technology Karnataka, Surathkal](https://www.nitk.ac.in/) in 2021. During my undergrad, I actively participated in academic research as well as in extracurricular activites through [IEEE NITK student branch](https://ieee.nitk.ac.in/), dance club, and volunteering services in local high schools.
