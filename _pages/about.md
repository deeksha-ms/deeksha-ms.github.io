I am a PhD student in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at [Johns Hopkins University](https://engineering.jhu.edu/ece/) and a visting researcher at [Boston University](https://www.bu.edu/eng/academics/departments-and-divisions/electrical-and-computer-engineering/). I am advised by [Dr. Archana Venkataraman](https://www.bu.edu/eng/profile/archana-venkataraman-ph-d/). My research interests lie in the intersection of Probabilistic Machine learning, Deep Learning, Signal Processing, and Medical Imaging. It involves high-dimesnional signal analysis with applications to diagnosis and therapeutics for neurological disorders. In particular, I aim to develop interpretable AI models of clinical utility while dealing with the challenges of small dataset and noisy EEG data from Epilepsy and Autism population. I cater to the areas of generative modeling, variational inference, attention models,  and learning with noisy labels. 

Previously, I worked as a Data Research Analsyst at [intelligent Global Health](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/mlo/igh-intelligent-global-health/) group of Machine Learning and Optimization lab at EPFL, Switzerland headed by [Dr. Martin Jaggi](https://people.epfl.ch/martin.jaggi). I also worked closely with [Dr. Mary-Anne Hartley](https://www.yale-light.org/) and [Dr. Tatjana Chavdarova](https://chavdarova.github.io/). Here, I contributed to the development of interpretable deep models for diagnosing respiratory ailments, particularly COVID-19, through recorded lung auscultation signals. I graduated from the Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering at [National Institute of Technology Karnataka, Surathkal](https://www.nitk.ac.in/) in 2021 with Institue Gold Medal (rank 1/112).

Being an extrovert, most of my ideas are inspired by my conversation with experts and fellow researchers in the field. I like to be creative in my ideas without breaking the barriers of simplicity and utility. I find it satisfying to help build technology that is of clinical importance which I have priorotized in my career choices. I envision working towards similar goals in the future with a focus on neurological disorders, mental health management, and women health. I strive for an all-rounded growth and a holistic lifestyle through active community involvement, art and culture, sustainable health, and informed personal choices.
