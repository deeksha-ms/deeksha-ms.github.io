I am a PhD student in the [Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://engineering.jhu.edu/ece/) at Johns Hopkins University and a visting researcher at [Boston University](https://www.bu.edu/eng/academics/departments-and-divisions/electrical-and-computer-engineering/). I am advised by [Dr. Archana Venkataraman](https://www.bu.edu/eng/profile/archana-venkataraman-ph-d/). My research interests lie in the intersection of Probabilistic Machine learning, Deep Learning, Signal Processing, and Medical Imaging. It involves high-dimesnional signal analysis with applications to diagnosis and biomarker identification for neurodegenerative diseases. 

Previously, I worked as a Data Research Analsyst at [intelligent Global Health](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/mlo/igh-intelligent-global-health/) group of MachineLearning and Optimization lab at EPFL, Switzerland. I was mentored ny [Dr. Martin Jaggi](https://people.epfl.ch/martin.jaggi), [Dr. Mary-Anne Hartley](https://www.yale-light.org/) and [Dr. Tatjana Chavdarova](https://chavdarova.github.io/). Here, I contributed to the development of interpretable deep models for analysing lung auscultation signals for diagnosing various resiporatory ailments as well as Covid-19. This work was in collaboration with the Geneva University Hospitals and [Pneumoscope](https://onescope.ch/). 

I graduated from the Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering [National Institute of Technology Karnataka, Surathkal](https://www.nitk.ac.in/) in 2021. During my undergrad, I actively participated in research in the department and through my summer internship at Indian Intitute of Science, Bangalore. I was involved in extracurricular activites in [IEEE NITK student branch](https://ieee.nitk.ac.in/), dance club, and volunteering services in local high schools. I was awarded with the Institute Gold Medal for my academic performance and [Best Outgoing Female student in IEEE India Council](https://www.hfrc-ieeeawards.org/index.php/winners-2021/) for my overall performance in 2021.
