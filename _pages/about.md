I am a PhD student in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at [Johns Hopkins University](https://engineering.jhu.edu/ece/) and a visting researcher at [Boston University](https://www.bu.edu/eng/academics/departments-and-divisions/electrical-and-computer-engineering/). I am advised by [Dr. Archana Venkataraman](https://www.bu.edu/eng/profile/archana-venkataraman-ph-d/). My research interests lie in the intersection of Probabilistic Machine learning, Deep Learning, Signal Processing, and Medical Imaging. It involves high-dimesnional signal analysis with applications to diagnosis and therapeutics for neurological disorders. In particular, I aim to develop interpretable AI models of clinical utility while dealing with the challenges of small dataset and noisy EEG data from Epilepsy and Autism population. I cater to the areas of generative modeling, variational inference, attention models,  and learning with noisy labels. 

I am a strong proponent of all-rounded growth, holistic life, and mental health management. Outside of research, I like to volunteer within and beyond my scientific and personal communitiies while maintaining and growing healthy connections I enjoy hiking, recently been conquering the While Mountains. I also dab my hand at artisttic endeavours details of which can be found in the background section. All said, I am an extroverted person and always cherish stimulating conversations. Feel free to reach out!
